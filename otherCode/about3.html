		I was born and raised in the Philippines, moved to the US when I was 11, studied abroad in Spain, and worked in Argentina right after college. Now I'm back and call New York City my home. My live-in-a-suitcase lifestyle could explain my love affair with learning and speaking foreign languages, knowing English, Spanish, Tagalog, French and Portuguese (for now).

		<a href="https://vimeo.com/34853044">Skillshare's</a> manifesto starts with saying that “the future belongs to the intellectually curious.” As a life-long learner, you will always find me reading multiple <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26964012-roxanne-ravago">books</a> at once, on <a href="http://99u.com/">99u</a>looking for insights on making ideas happen, journaling to capture my inner thoughts and observations about life, continuing my education on and offline, picking up a new skill, having many conversations. different, sometimes uncomfortable conversations with people, from strangers to family, and constantly challenging myself to make connections between these seemingly disparate dots.

		In the words of Steve Jobs, "Creativity is just connecting things.

That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things."

		My go-to dish is Sichuan ma po tofu. I own two stuffed animals, a French puppy named Rouge, and a panda named Piccollo.

		When life gives me lemons, I bake an Lemon Merengue Pie for a potluck to share with friends where I end up burning it, so I try again, and burn it again. Realizing that I'm not so hot on baking pies, I cook a savory <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-lemon-frittata-with-lee-77048">Lemon Frittata with Leaks and Goat Cheese</a> instead (successfully).
